<p>In the course of executing a business decision, or a business logic in a database application, special occasions may arise where if some specific action occurs, </p><blockquote><p>you want that action to cause another action, or perhaps a succession of actions, to occur.</p></blockquote><p>In a way, that first action TRIGGERS the execution of the following actions. The SQL provides the <strong>TRIGGER</strong> mechanism to provide this capability. </p><blockquote><p>A trigger is an action or event that causes another event to occur</p></blockquote><p>A triggering SQL statement causes another SQL statement (the trigger statement) to be executed. </p><p><br>Triggers can also be used to keep a database consistent. For example, in an order entry application, an order for a specific product can trigger a statement that can change the status of that product in the master inventory table status from available to reserved. Similarly, the deletion of a row in the order table can trigger a statement that changes the status of the subject product status from reserved to available.</p>
