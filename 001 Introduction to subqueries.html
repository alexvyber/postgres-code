<p>In a practical database structure, the data is scattered across multiple tables. Most queries that you want to make need to pull data from two or more tables. <br></p><ul><li><p>One way to do this is to use a JOIN operator or one of the other operational operators like UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT etc. The relational operators take information from multiple tables and combine them into a single result set. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Another way to pull data from multiple tables is to use a <strong>nested query.</strong> In SQL, a nested query is one in which an enclosing statement contains within it a <strong>subquery. </strong></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Subqueries are invariably SELECT statements, </strong>but the outermost enclosing statement may also be an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>A subquery can operate on a table other than the table that its enclosing statement operates on, so nested queries give you another way to extract information from multiple tables. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>A subquery is simply one query nested inside of another query, usually in the SELECT, FROM or WHERE clause.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Subqueries are useful when the query we want to create requires a few additional steps or calculations to produce the dataset we desire. For example, subqueries are very helpful for scenarios where we want to view or compare a query by a condition that requires its own query to calculate. Instead of writing one query, then copying the results into the next query, we can use a subquery that performs both operations at once.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Subqueries also provide us with another method of simultaneously accessing data from more than one table.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Subqueries can help us perform a calculation in one table and then use that calculation in conjunction with another table.</p></li></ul>
