<blockquote><p><strong>BACKUP&nbsp;YOUR DATABASES REGULARLY</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Data is hard to retrieve </strong></p><p>especially after a power surge, a fire and other unforeseen events. Remember, sometimes the computers just stop working for no good reason, so plan it accordingly. Make frequent backups and put the backup media in a secure and safe place.<br></p><p>What constitute a 'safe place' depends on how critical your data is. It might be a fireproof safe in the same room as your computer. It might be in another building, or it might be on a cloud hosting platform or it might be a concrete bunker under a mountain that has been hardened to withstand natural disasters etc. You&nbsp; need to decide your <strong>'Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)' </strong>accordingly.<br><br>Always plan, so that you can execute the plan when it is needed the most!</p><p><br></p>
