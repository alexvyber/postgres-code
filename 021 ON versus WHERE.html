<p>The function of the ON and WHERE clauses in the various types of the joins like INNER, OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT and more are might be a bit confusing. The following facts may help you keep things straight:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>The ON&nbsp;clause is part of the INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL&nbsp;joins. The CROSS join and UNION join don't have an ON clause because neither of them does any filtering of the data.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The ON clause in an inner join is logically equivalent to a WHERE clause. i.e. the same condition could be specified either in an ON&nbsp;clause or a WHERE clause</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The ON clauses in outer join i.e. LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL&nbsp;joins are different from WHERE clauses. </p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>The WHERE clause simply filter the rows returned by the FROM&nbsp;clause. Rows rejected by the filter are not included in the result.</p><p> </p></li><li><p>The ON clause in an outer join first filters the rows of a cross product and then includes the rejected rows, extended with nulls values.</p></li></ol></li></ol>
