<p><strong><em>Quick Recap : Single and Multi-dimensional arrays</em></strong></p><p><em><br>There's a number of datatypes available in PostgreSQL. </em>There are times when you might want to <strong>store multiple values</strong> in one database column instead of across multiple tables. PostgreSQL gives you this capability with the <strong>array datatype.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Arrays are some of the most useful data types for <strong>storing lists of information.</strong> Whether you have a list of baseball scores, blog tags, or favorite book titles, arrays can be found everywhere. The bigger question, however, is why you'd even consider using arrays. The answer comes down to performance and ease of use. </p></li><li><p>Aggregating and joining data across tables and rows can be difficult, and depending on the type of data you're storing, it might get expensive too.</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL gives the opportunity <strong>to define a column of a table as a variable length single or multidimensional array. </strong></p></li><li><p>Arrays of any built-in or <strong>user-defined base type, enum type, or composite type</strong> can be created.</p></li><li><p>Arrays can be used to <strong>denormalize data and avoid lookup tables</strong>. A good rule of thumb for using them that way is that you mostly use the array as a whole, even if you might at times search for elements in the array. </p></li><li><p>Heavier processing is going to be more complex than a lookup table.</p></li><li><p>Think of an array as An array is essentially a group or list of items.</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL allows a table column to <strong>contain multi-dimensional arrays</strong> that can be of any built-in or user-defined data type.</p></li><li><p>Arrays have an advantage over large plain text fields in that <strong>data remains in a discreet and addressable form</strong>. PostgreSQL also has a lot of functions dealing with arrays.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>One Dimensional Array</strong></p><ul><li><p>It is a list of some values bundle together</p></li><li><p>It allows random access and all the elements can be accessed with the help of their index.</p></li><li><p>The size of the array is fixed.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Multi-dimensional array</strong></p><ul><li><p>It also allows random access and all the elements can be accessed with the help of their index.</p></li><li><p>It can also be seen as a collection of 1D arrays. It is also known as the <strong>Matrix</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Its dimension can be increased from 2 to 3 and 4 so on.</p></li><li><p>Store a<strong> list of lists</strong> of the element</p></li><li><p>Represent multiple data items as a table consisting of rows and columns.</p></li><li><p>Multi-dimensional arrays are used to implement matrices.</p><p><br></p></li></ul>
